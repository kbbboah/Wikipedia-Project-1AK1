          Nestor Ivanovych Makhno[a] >(Ukrainian: Не́стор Івáнович Махно́,
          pronounced [ˈnɛstor iˈʋɑnowɪt͡ʃ mɐxˈnɔ]; 7 November 1888 – 25 July
          1934), also known as Batko Makhno (батько Махно, lit. 'Father
          Makhno'),[b] was a Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary and the commander
          of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine during the Ukrainian
          War of Independence. He established the Makhnovshchina (loosely
          translated as "Makhno movement"), a mass movement by the Ukrainian
          peasantry to establish anarchist communism in the country between 1918
          and 1921. Initially centered around Makhno's home province of
          Katerynoslav and hometown of Huliaipole, it came to exert a strong
          influence over large areas of southern Ukraine, specifically in what
          is now the Zaporizhzhia Oblast of Ukraine. Raised by a peasant family
          in the fervor around the 1905 Revolution, Makhno participated in a
          local anarchist group and spent seven years imprisoned for his
          involvement. With his release during the 1917 Revolution, Makhno
          became a local revolutionary leader in his hometown and oversaw the
          expropriation and redistribution of large estates to the peasantry. In
          the Ukrainian Civil War, Makhno sided with the Soviet Russian
          Bolsheviks against the Ukrainian nationalists and White movement, but
          his alliances with the Bolsheviks did not last. He rallied Bolshevik
          support to lead an insurgency, defeating the Central Powers's
          occupation forces at the Battle of Dibrivka and establishing the
          Makhnovshchina. Makhno's troops briefly integrated with the Bolshevik
          Red Army in the 1919 Soviet invasion of Ukraine, but split over
          differences on the movement's autonomy. Makhno rebuilt his army from
          the remains of Nykyfor Hryhoriv's forces in western Ukraine, routed
          the White Army at the Battle of Perehonivka, and captured most of
          southern and eastern Ukraine, where they again attempted to establish
          anarchist communism.
